#This is the main part, which reassigns keys, sets the content of the display and updates the LEDs.
#The logic of this is built around "modes". The modes themselves are defined in "modes.py", where you can
#change key assignments, images, LED animations and their entire logic.

#Below, you only define a list of modes (defined in "modes.py") that are active and set either a process
#(mode would be active whenever the process runs) or an active window (mode is active if the window has
#the focus. The latter is a compiled regular expression pattern. Mode priority corresponds to the order in the
#list, so the first mode with a matching process or active window will be activated.
